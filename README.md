## Bio

I am Mario Ortega and I am a second year PhD student in the Nuclear Engineering department at UC Berkeley. My research focus is on deterministic methods in numerical radiation transport and analytical solutions of the radiation transport equation. My research focuses specifically on criticality eigenvalue problems. Criticality is the ability of a system to sustain a nuclear chain reaction. With the focus on eigenvalue problems, numerical linear algebra is a necessary component of any numerical method. I hope to learn in CS267 how to write algorithms and methods that can take advantage of parallelization.
